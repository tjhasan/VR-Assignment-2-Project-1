# VR-Assignment-2-Project-1 By Mohd Hasan (TJ)

## Known Bugs:
	* Meteors sometimes take more than one shot to destroy.
	* Bullets sometimes curve as they fire.
	* Meteor falling sound keeps looping even after leaving the attuanting zone.

## Description:
	* Game is a basic defense game where the main objective is to protect a building in the center of the table, with only a Gun and your wits to progress!
	* Currently 4 levels of difficulty implemented, incrementing with the progression of time.
	* At each difficulty level, the speed and spawn rate of the meteors increase.
	* The gun, objective, floor, table, and meteors all have textures added to them. These textures have been acquired freely online and are not to be used for monitization purposes.
	* Sound effects are likewise sourced from a free sound website, and edited using audacity.
	* Game resets after every loss.
